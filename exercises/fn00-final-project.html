<p><strong>Wednesday, May 3rd at 11:59pm</strong> - Final Presentation Recording - You and your team are required to submit final recording deliverables.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday, May 3rd at 11:59pm</strong> - Final Individual Hand-in - You and your team are required to submit final, individual forms. This form will post to Gradescope on Saturday, April 29th and is due by Wednesday, May 3rd at 11:59pm. You should submit this <em>after</em> your team has submitted the final presentation recording.</p>
<p><strong>Friday, May 5th at 4pm</strong> - Final Demo Day - Everyone is required to attend and participate in our final exam meeting time to present final projects. There will be a paper hand-in that is required to be submitted to receive credit for the final project assignment in the course worth 50% of your course grade.</p>
<h2 id="final-presentation-recording">Final Presentation Recording</h2>
<p>Prepare and record a 5 to 10 minute presentation with your team.</p>
<p>Your goal is to craft an engaging presentation to communicate the value of your feature to your primary persona. What is the problem your feature addresses and how does your feature solve it? Your presentation must include a real demonstration of your project clearly running on CloudApps staging. The demo should emphasize your primary personaâ€™s usage of the feature as well as a quick walkthrough of any functional secondary and administrative features. Finally, discuss the most significant challenges you faced as a team and the functionality you would prioritize adding to your feature as future work.</p>
<p>You are free to structure the presentation as youâ€™d like as long as it addresses the concerns in the previous paragraphs in 10 minutes or less. This presentation is effectively practice for final demo day, so you should use it imagining this is how you will present on demo day to peers in the course.</p>
<p>Slides are not required, but you are free to use them if you find it useful. Record your video using any software you are comfortable with; Zoom is fine.</p>
<p>Upload your video to YouTube and be sure it is set to unlisted or public. Test viewing your video from both an incognito window and a partnerâ€™s computer to confirm we are able to view it.</p>
<p>Submit your video to Gradescope.</p>
